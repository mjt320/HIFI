HIFI_3a
-------
based on relax2.4 - HIFI processing code separated from rest
opts.NSlices no longer needed - acqPars.NSlices is calculated from number of dicom files (however, need to specify this manually whens slice oversampling was used)
uses dcm2niix instead of SPM for dicom conversion
uses fslmerge instead of spm_file_merge
